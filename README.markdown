# Code.js

## Welcome to Web 3.0


 
 **Class / Object Development Evironment for Javascript**
 
  * Code.js is a dialect of javascript that will make it natural for AS3 programmers to transition into Web standards.
  * The project aims to be truly cross-browser under the hood, so users will only need to think about their creative goals.
  * Code.js is a compact js library that loads a module called Fase.js, a collection of classes familiar to Flash developers for creating and manipulating a DisplayList within the DOM.
  
## Why?

  * We want to put the art back into front end development, and allow creative coders to focus on more beautiful things than cross-browser development, or copying and pasting old XHTML, CSS, JS, etc.
  * Code( 'MyApp.js') { provides HTML5 *without* hiccups.
